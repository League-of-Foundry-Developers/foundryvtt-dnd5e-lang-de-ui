You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p><p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p><p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance.

Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"wizard","levels":1,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"]},"value":{"added":{"0rezvlf2ul1kjm7d":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","mb3aiiyoga49hld8":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"]},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max"},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}}},{"_id":"0rezvlf2ul1kjm7d","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order.

Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Blade. </strong></em>If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Tome. </strong></em>Your Book of Shadows could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Otherworldly Patrons</h1>\n<p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p>\n<p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.WPFVBg589uI8iOMH]{The Fiend}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"warlock","levels":1,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6wykf1qry5o7swn1","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.jTXHaK0vvT5DV3uO","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.x6IJZwr6f0SGral7"]},"value":{"added":{"8eas0z5toxxu5poz":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.jTXHaK0vvT5DV3uO","thjhxktqgk0fp7jx":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.x6IJZwr6f0SGral7"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"rhw4wpt4eqn0mg7e","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8MlxM2nEfE3Q0EVk"]},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"uh49ihpbnqvy8jdu","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.QwgfIpCN8VWfoUtX"]},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"j2llrpqzdjszdqcr","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.zB77V8BcCJvWVxck"]},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"4rqq43u7wtq9vn1k","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.HBn6FXLz7Eiudz0V"]},"value":{},"level":13,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"05ek6hg9mar50thz","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.knDZR4l4QfLTKinm"]},"value":{},"level":15,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"85feykdd4eyor8d1","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.vMxJQEKeK6WwZFaF"]},"value":{},"level":17,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"fd0c4m55mgtb5t8u","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.0C04rwyvoknvFYiy"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"s35gtvg38bkm24iq","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max"},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","his","itm","inv","nat","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"pact","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.7WJp9vhi6F6SlAFa"}}},{"_id":"8eas0z5toxxu5poz","name":"Otherworldly Patron","type":"feat","img":"icons/sundries/lights/candles-lit-red-evil.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being, such as the Fiend.

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities).
